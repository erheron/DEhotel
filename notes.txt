1) How is hotel built?
apropos wyposa≈ºenia
All equipment is taken from real-world objects
I've decided to take IKEA because they have nice names for each object

cheaper equipment matches to cheaper rooms, and more expensive - to appropriate ones
that is done programmaticaly too - minimum typing :) (well, it was not so easy...)


for some equipment we have few ones in reserve - just in case, for some we don't
