column "email" in klienci now can be null, deleted constraint on "unique"
added column "typ" to pokoje
deleted redundant 'pierwsza wizyta' from goscie
deleted constraint on unique telefone number(sometimes it just isn't true, providers sell old numbers)
'nazwa' is no longer primary key in 'rodzaje_wyposazenia', because of memory
added half-done init.sh - it will do all work for user(TODO)
